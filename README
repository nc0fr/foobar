                    GOOGLE FOOBAR: My winning participatiosn
                         to the Google FooBar challenge



   Why Making it Public?

At first, this repository was left private, to avoid releasing solutions to
other participants.  However, since Google *unofficially* announced the death
of the project to April 1st, 2024, I decided to make it public.

I do hope the solutions here may someday be helpful (even to myself), or
inspire me to make something similar ;).


   What is Google FooBar?

Google FooBar was a secret recruiting program by Google.  It was a series of
complex computer science problems, which were presented to the user in a cool
storyline.  The user was given a time limit to solve the problems, and the
user's performance was evaluated by Google.  If the user did well, they would
be invited to apply for a job at Google.

(For more information, see the Wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Foobar).

> For those wondering, I did receive an offer, but I didn't accept it, I'm a
> true sigma male.


   Where?

Google FooBar was hosted online at https://foobar.withgoogle.com.  While not
officially announced, it was invite-only.
